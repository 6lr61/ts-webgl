# WebGL Examples in TypeScript

These examples were written during [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/adrian_learns) and they're somewhat following the [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) guide.

The pages are built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and the matrix calculations are done using [glMatrix](https://glmatrix.net/).

## Setup and use

Install the dependencies

```console
npm install
```

Run the development server

```console
npm run dev
```

Or build the static pages

```console
npm run build
```

## Development

To add more examples `vite.config.js` has to be used.
